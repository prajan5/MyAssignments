Frameworks defines certain rules and regulation and these rules & regulations need to be followed

An abstract or a normal/concreate class can IMPLEMENT an interface or more than one interface
Interfaces have static and final variables, 
which have to be initialised and is compulsory i.e. we need to 
declare the variable value and this value cannot be changed in the classes implementing the interface
Static and final variables may uses static  or final keywords. Even if they are not defined they will be static and final variables
Static and final variables in interfaces can be have only PUBLIC .specifiers. . Even if PUBLIC are not defined they will be PUBLIC . We do not PROTECTED and PRIVATE global variables in interfaces
